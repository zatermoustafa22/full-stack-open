In this exercise, I implemented backend and frontend with node and react for part3 from Full Stack open. This was deployed in render, and have this link:

# Run locally 

This app was configured to run in port arbitrary, and you can start dev mode with this:

```
cd ../phonebook/backend
npm install
```
Also need to set environment variables how as `MONGODB_URI` and `PORT`. 
```
npm run dev
```
